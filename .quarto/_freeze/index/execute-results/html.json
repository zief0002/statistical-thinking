Here you will be able to access materials such as readings, data sets, and the lab manual. The website also includes helpful links and resources for each of the course topics.\n\n<br />\n\nThe resources that accompany this website include:\n\n- A lab manual [PDF copy available here](https://github.com/zief0002/statistical-thinking/blob/main/statistical-thinking-v4_5.pdf?raw=true)\n- Data sets used in the lab manual:\n  + [TinkerPlots 3 Data Files](https://github.com/zief0002/statistical-thinking/blob/main/tp3-data.zip?raw=true)\n\n\nYou can read more about these resources in the introduction.\n\n<br />\n\n### Licensing and Attribution {.unnumbered}\n\nCopyright &copy; 2025 Catalysts for Change\n\nPUBLISHED BY CATALYST PRESS\n\n<a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\"><img alt=\"Creative Commons License\" style=\"border-width:0\" src=\"https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by/4.0/88x31.png\" /></a>\n\nThis work is licensed under a <a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License</a>.
